                <p>There was such a need of goods of all kinds that he sold almost everything as soon as he arrived. He had nothing left to sell except several rolls of light canvas with which he intended to make tents for the miners. He bought a wagon, loaded it with his rolls of material, and set out to sell it. But when one of the first miners told him of a special problem, he suddenly got an idea. It was then that one of the great success stories of America was born.</p>

                <p>Nowhere in San Francisco could the miners find clothing which was strong enough to withstand the wear and tear of the rocky terrain where they looked for gold. The young immigrant went to a tailor and had all of his material, a light canvas called “denim,” made into pants in several sizes. He sold them all in one day, then began improving his new product. Leaming that the pockets often tore from the weight of heavy rocks, he got the idea of fixing the pockets in place with copper rivets. </p>
